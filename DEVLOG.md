minor rants from developer while doing this thing

## 2019-11-30

kinda works. tested on samsung galaxy S10 and mutilaser 10" tablet, don't know which versin exactly.

Still need to tune the admin lock screeen permission. you grant the thing and the app, which simply
should never appear, stares it's blank screen to the user.
